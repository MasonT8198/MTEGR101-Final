## My Vision: What Changed?

??? resource "Context"

     At the beginning of the semester I wrote a short essay on why I decided to become an engineer and Reflecting back on that essay, my vision has changed slightly, which is why I chose engineering. (B.S. in Computer Engineering)

My vision of my academic and professional future **has** changed slightly since I started my major. Initially, I felt that my major in Computer Engineering did not have much application in the computer science field, which is a major hobby of mine. However, as I progressed in my studies, I realized that Computer Engineering and Computer Science are not mutually exclusive disciplines. In fact, Computer Engineering has a lot of influence and relevance in the computer science field, especially with the emphasis on computer hardware. By learning how to design, test, and integrate hardware and software systems, I can improve my knowledge and skills regarding software development. Moreover, I can explore various topics and applications that interest me, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, or web design. Therefore, I believe that my major in Computer Engineering is not only challenging and rewarding, but also aligned with my personal passion for computer science.

## Why You Should Choose Engineering

Engineering is a field that can be one of the most fulfilling careers that a person could ever have. Engineers use their creativity, logic, and problem-solving skills to design, create, and test structures, machines, systems, or processes that benefit society. Whether you are interested in physics, construction, biotechnology, or something else, you can find an engineering specialization that suits your goals and preferences. As an engineer, you can work on projects that have a positive impact on the world, such as developing clean energy sources, improving transportation systems, designing prosthetic limbs, or alleviating hunger problems. Do you have an idea that no one has ever created? You can obtain the tools and knowledge to make it a reality, and you could improve your own and othersâ€™ general quality of life. Engineering is also a rewarding career in terms of salary, job stability, work environment, and opportunities for growth and travel. [According to Indeed, the average salary for an engineer is $61,052 per year](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/careers-in-engineering), and engineers can work in offices, on-site projects, or anywhere in the world. Engineering is not only a challenging and fun profession, but also a very fulfilling one.
