# What being a Successful Engineer in the Real World is to me

To me, being a successful engineer in the real world means being able to apply my knowledge and skills to create innovative and impactful solutions for the problems and needs of society. It also means being able to adapt to the changing demands and challenges of the engineering field, and continuously learn and improve myself as a professional and as a person. It also means being able to collaborate and communicate effectively with other engineers and stakeholders, and contribute to the advancement and development of the engineering discipline and community.

## My Vision

My vision for my professional position upon graduation is to work as a computer engineer in a reputable and leading technology company, where I can gain valuable experience and exposure to various aspects and domains of computer engineering. I would like to work on projects that involve developing, testing, and refining computer systems, software, and equipment that are relevant and beneficial for society, such as improving cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, designing robots and supercomputers, creating new software systems, and more. I would also like to work with a diverse and supportive team of engineers and mentors, who can help me grow and learn as a computer engineer.

## Looking Beyond

Five or ten years beyond that, I envision myself as a senior computer engineer or a project manager, who can lead and oversee the design, development, and implementation of complex and large-scale computer engineering projects. I would also like to have a more active and influential role in the computer engineering community, such as participating in conferences, workshops, and publications, and mentoring and inspiring the next generation of computer engineers. I would also like to pursue further education and research in computer engineering, and explore new and emerging areas and applications of the field.
