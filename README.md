# Welcome!

This is my EGR101 Final Project for the Gallery Walk in 2023, this project is built using Mkdocs-Material, with a few plugins, and deployed off my NAS onto the web using a github.io link...

If you'd like to clone the project please install git, and/or WSL for Windows (Doesn't apply if you're using Linux)

Run the following command `git clone https://github.com/MasonT8198/MTEGR101-Final.git`

`cd` into the directory, and after you've installed the plugins listed below alongside [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) run `mkdocs serve` and you can live edit and host the site yourself!
